While the difference in speed between 19 and 25 mph is noticeable, it's significantly smaller than the difference between 43 and 68 mph. This means that increasing the speed from 43 to 68 mph will likely result in a much greater reduction in travel time compared to increasing the speed from 19 to 25 mph. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that increasing speed also comes with increased risks.
