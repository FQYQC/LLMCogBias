So, let's assume the chosen number X is 150.\n\nFor question 3, with X being 150, the average person might estimate John having **less than 150 phones** in his shop. This is influenced by the **anchoring bias**. The number 150, established in the earlier question, acts as an anchor, influencing the subsequent estimate. \n\nFor question 4, without any additional information, the average person might provide a guess close to the anchor, perhaps around **100-120 phones**. This is still under the influence of the anchoring bias. \n\n## Cognitive Biases at Play:\n\n*   **Availability Heuristic:** People tend to rely on readily available examples or information when making judgments. Choosing numbers ending in 0 or 5 is easier due to their familiarity.\n*   **Anchoring Bias:** The initial exposure to the number 150 influences subsequent estimations, pulling the guesses closer to this anchor value, even if it might be irrelevant to the actual number of phones in the shop.\n\n## Unbiased Answer:\n\nWithout any information about the size or type of John's phone shop, it is impossible to accurately estimate the number of phones he has in stock. \n",
                "## Predicting the Average Person's Answer:\n\nFor question 1, most people tend to choose numbers ending in 0 or 5 due to the **availability heuristic**, making these numbers easier to recall and manipulate mentally. Let's assume the chosen number is 150 (X).\n\nFor question 3, with X being 150, the average person might estimate John to have **less than 150 phones** in his shop. This is likely influenced by the **anchoring bias**. The initial random number (150) acts as an anchor, and people adjust their estimate based on it, often insufficiently. \n\nFor question 4, the exact number will vary greatly depending on the individual's perception of a typical phone shop's size and inventory. However, the estimate is likely to remain under 150 due to the anchoring bias. \n\n## Cognitive Biases at Play:\n\n*   **Availability Heuristic:** People tend to rely on readily available information or examples when making judgments.

This overestimation is due to the intuitive but flawed linear thinking that doubling the speed would halve the time. \n\n## Cognitive Biases at Play:\n\n*   **Anchoring Bias:** People tend to anchor their estimates to the initial values presented (60 mph and 80 mph) and make insufficient adjustments. They might think, \"80 is much bigger than 60, so I'll save a lot of time.\"\n*   **Availability Heuristic:** People often rely on easily accessible information or mental shortcuts. Since most people have experience with driving at both speeds, they might base their estimate on a rough feeling of how much faster 80 mph feels compared to 60 mph, without doing the actual math.\n\n## Unbiased Answer:\n\nDriving 10 miles at 80 mph instead of 60 mph would save approximately **2 minutes and 24 seconds**. \n",

This is because they would likely perform a rough mental calculation, assuming a linear relationship between speed and time. They might reason that increasing speed by 20 mph would lead to a time saving proportional to this increase. \n\n## Cognitive Biases at Play:\n\n* **Anchoring Bias:** The initial speeds of 60 mph and 80 mph act as anchors, and people might base their estimates on the difference between these two numbers (20 mph) rather than considering the actual time it takes to travel 10 miles at each speed.\n* **Availability Heuristic:** People might rely on their readily available experiences with driving, which often involve shorter distances and smaller speed variations. This can lead to an overestimation of the time saved.\n* **Linearity Bias:** The assumption of a linear relationship between speed and time ignores the fact that the time saved by increasing speed is not constant but diminishes as speed increases.\n\n## Unbiased Answer:\n\nDriving 10 miles at 80 mph instead of 60 mph would save approximately **2 minutes and 30 seconds**. \n",
                "## Predicting the Average Person's Response and Analyzing Bias\n\nThe average person, without putting too much thought into it, would likely answer **20 minutes**. This is because they would intuitively subtract the travel times at each speed:\n\n*   At 60 mph, it takes 10 minutes to travel 10 miles (10 miles / 60 mph * 60 minutes/hour = 10 minutes).\n*   At 80 mph, it takes 7.5 minutes to travel 10 miles (10 miles / 80 mph * 60 minutes/hour = 7.5 minutes).\n*   Subtracting these times gives 2.5 minutes (10 minutes - 7.5 minutes = 2.5 minutes).\n\nHowever, this intuitive approach is affected by a cognitive bias known as the **anchoring bias**. People tend to anchor their estimates to an initial value (in this case, the 10 minutes travel time at 60 mph) and adjust insufficiently from that anchor, leading to an overestimation of the time saved.\n\n## Unbiased Answer\n\nThe actual time saved by driving 10 miles at 80 mph instead of 60 mph is **2.5 minutes**. \n",

They might neglect to consider the context of a 10-mile distance.\n* **Proportional Reasoning Bias:** The assumption that time saved is directly proportional to the increase in speed is a common cognitive shortcut that can lead to inaccurate estimations in this case. \n\n## Unbiased Answer:\n\nDriving 10 miles at 80 mph instead of 60 mph saves approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds. \n",
