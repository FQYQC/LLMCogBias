However, a smaller shop would likely have fewer phones in stock than a larger shop.\n* **Customer Demand:** The number of phones John keeps in stock will also depend on the demand from his customers.

This will help you ensure that you're getting the best possible price.\n* **Clean your phone.** Before you sell your phone, be sure to clean it thoroughly. This will make it more appealing to buyers and could help you get a higher price.\n* **Be honest about the condition of your phone.** If your phone has any damage, be sure to disclose it to potential buyers.
